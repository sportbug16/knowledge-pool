# knowledge-pool
Our job as  developer interns at Voice Qube is to aid the company in the development of a web-app that uses OpenAI's API (gpt-3.5-turbo) to generate questions based on Data Structures and Algortihm. The app takes in the subtopics (eg: arrays, vectors, etc.) , the difficulty (easy, medium , hard), the number of questions and the type of question(s) (MCQ, Subjective , or Coding Question) as inputs. These inputs are then used to form a prompt which will be used while calling OpenAI's API. 

The web app also gives users the ability to have their own profiles so as to visit the questions generated by them whenever they want to. The main idea is to to form an ever increasing knowledge-pool of questions. Theses questions can then be used in the formation of an test paper that helps students during placement season.

Frontend was made using: React.js, HTML, CSS, Material UI
Backend Development: Express.js
Database Managment done using : MongoDB
(MERN Stack)
